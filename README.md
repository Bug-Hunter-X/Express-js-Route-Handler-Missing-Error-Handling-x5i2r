# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid user IDs.  The provided code lacks checks for scenarios where a user ID is not found or is invalid, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in web applications built with Express.js to ensure robustness and prevent unexpected application crashes.
